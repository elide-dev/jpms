# Dependency Graph

This sub-directory provides a mock Maven project which "depends on" all the libraries provided by this repository, by way of the published BOM. GitHub [Dependency Graph][0] data is computed based on the resulting effective POM.

See [the main CI job](../../.github/workflows/ci.build-test.yml).
