## JPMS Attic

This repository provides sub-module library overrides for popular Java libraries which don't yet provide JPMS support (at least until some PRs are merged!). There is a Maven repository which contains these artifacts, too, so you can safely use them in your projects.

### What libraries are included?

Coming soon.

### How do I use it?

Coming soon.
