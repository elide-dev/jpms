# Repository Indexes

This directory holds generated JSON files which index the contents of the JPMS Attic repository. Please do not edit these files manually; instead, run `pnpm run indexer` from the root project.

See the [`@javamodules/indexer`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@javamodules/indexer) package for use of these indexes.
